To build the project i recommend to use the python module pyinstaller, to use it go into the folder where your main.py lives
then run:

pyinstaller main.py --onefile
for normal code change

IF YOUR TRYING TO ADD A NEW LIBRARY:

if your trying to add a new library, follow the conventions in the conventions.md then run this:

pyinstaller main.py --onefile --hidden-import=LIB_{libraryNAME}

then get the result in the dist folder and put it in the root dist folder for the file structire
