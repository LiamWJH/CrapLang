# Conventions
this file contains all the conventions when coding naming and organizing files and changes that is _strongly_ recommended for all changes

## Coding
 - TABS: we prefer four spaces over any other styles
 - variables: we like all variables as local as possible, and with them not containing as numbers if possible
 - if while and for and functions: if linked to each other such as
 ```
 if "blah" < "blaha":
    print("Hi")

 else:
    print("Bye)
 ```
 we like it if we have a newline after each section for before the new section

 ## Library naming
 we name librarys in the format of LIB_libraryname, and we prefer names as exppressive and useful libraries

 ## Example naming
 we name examples with expressive name such as fibonazi.crap or stringlib.crap
